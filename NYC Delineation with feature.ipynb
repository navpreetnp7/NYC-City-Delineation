    "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning methods designed to perform inference on data described by graphs. GNNs are neural networks that can be directly applied to graphs, and provide an easy way to do node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anything that is composed of linked entities can be represented as a graph. Graphs are excellent tools to visualize relations between people, objects, and concepts. With graphs becoming more pervasive and richer with information, and artificial neural networks becoming more popular and capable, GNNs have become a powerful tool for many important applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='GNN.png' width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph neural networks can be created like any other neural network, using fully connected layers, convolutional layers, pooling layers, etc. The type and number of layers depend on the type and complexity of the graph data and the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GNN receives the formatted graph data as input and produces a vector of numerical values that represent relevant information about nodes and their relations. This vector representation is called “graph embedding.”\n",
    "\n",
    "One very popular GNN architecture is the graph convolutional neural network (GCN), which uses convolution layers to create graph embeddings. (Kipf, T.N. and Welling, M., 2016. Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recent years, a lot of work has been done on the problem of generalizing neural networks to work on arbitrarily structured graphs - Bruna, J., Zaremba, W., Szlam, A. and LeCun, Y., 2013. Spectral networks and locally connected networks on graphs. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6203.pdf%20http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6203.pdf,  Henaff, M., Bruna, J. and LeCun, Y., 2015. Deep convolutional networks on graph-structured data. https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05163 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Few applications for graph neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node classification: One of the powerful applications of GNNs is adding new information to nodes or filling gaps where information is missing. For example, say you are running a social network and you have spotted a few bot accounts. Now you want to find out if there are other bot accounts in your network. You can train a GNN to classify other users in the social network as “bot” or “not bot” based on how close their graph embeddings are to those of the known bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Edge prediction: Another way to put GNNs to use is to find new edges that can add value to the graph. Going back to our social network, a GNN can find users (nodes) who are close to you in embedding space but who aren’t your friends yet (i.e., there isn’t an edge connecting you to each other). These users can then be introduced to you as friend suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustering: GNNs can glean new structural information from graphs. For example, in a social network where everyone is in one way or another related to others (through friends, or friends of friends, etc.), the GNN can find nodes that form clusters in the embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive tutorial on GNNs by Stanford is available on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn\n",
    "\n",
    "### GNN for city delineation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate an application for GNN for city borough delineation. The relationships among various entities such as interaction among people, intra-city mobility, social media interactions can be interpreted in terms of graphs with many features associated with nodes, edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the LEHD mobility network among zip codes in NYC and use it to learn the corresponding borough of zip codes (nodes) in the city. "
